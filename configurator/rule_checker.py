'''
@rules must be class methods because creating an instance for each decorator is
a problem, given that the different arguments required by different decorator
constructors. The solution is to use @rules as Class Methods, with no arguments
besides decorated.
If decorators instance attributes are needed they should be used at decorate(),
making that some object can pass the @rule tests but get an extra error while
trying to decorate() it. Anyway, checking decorators instance attributes for
decoration maybe is a bad practice, given that decorators are created for
decorating an object (having setted only very basic attributes), thus, it starts
operating - and changing its state - only after the decoration.
